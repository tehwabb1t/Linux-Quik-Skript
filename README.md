# fantastic-eureka
Linux help

This is my default update and upgrade skript, i added AutoClean and AutoRemove to tidy up the system.
Oh and i added a Reboot at the end, if you don;t want to reboot each time jus edit the skript and add
a # before any command you don't want to run.
example : 
# sudo reboot now


Any problems gimme a shout here : https://github.com/tehwabb1t
